# "Maya Lama" Immersive Artwork Portfolio

## Project Overview
Build a functional artwork portfolio website for "Maya Lama" that features her artwork.

## Standard Workflow

Use this workflow when working on a new task:

1. First, think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to the end of this file: tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them.
3. Before you begin working, check in with the team to verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them off as you complete them.
5. Finally, add a review section to this todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.

### Developer's First Steps

1.  Initialize a new Next.js project with Tailwind CSS.
- all the required dependencies are outlined in the `package.json` file.
2.  Install `framer-motion` and `lucide-react`.
3.  In the `public/artwork/` folder structure, create the remaning folders and populate it with a optimized version of the test images provided in the `test-images` folder.
4.  Begin by building the **Homepage** exactly as specified, focusing on the layout and typography.
5.  Once the Homepage is complete, build the **Artwork Viewer** page, focusing on the horizontal scroll and preloading logic first, then adding the UI overlays.
