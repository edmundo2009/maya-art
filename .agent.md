# Workspace notes

- previous folder structure
ARTIST MONOLOGUES 
BUBBLE MOON 
QUEST FOR INFINITY 
WEATHER REPORT 
thumbnail-placeholder.jpg

The current code is implemented for this folder structure.
the thumbnail-placeholder.jpg was duplicated 4 times as a thumbnail on the main page.

- the new folder structure is all sequentially labelled.
1. Artist Monologues 
2. Quest for Infinity 
3. Weather Report 
4. Bubble Moon 
Thumbnail images and text

the folder "Thumbnail images and text" contains the 4 unique thumbnails for each placeholder on the main page. follow the numbering guide for placement from left to right. the imgs are of the same dimension as prior placeholder, so no need to change the code for placement. the new thumbnail images have text embedded, therefore delete all the text formatting done for responsive design when there was text involved. create responsive layout just for the thumbnail images, and also do not delete the subtle hover effect that was created for the overlaid text. delete the code for the text itself but retain the background and hover effect for the text part. the new hover effect, the white bg blur effect would only cover the bottom part of the whole thumbnail, where there were text initially. the subtle zoom effect of 3-5% currently implemented for hover should remain as is.

# MOST IMPORTANT
all the assets and imgs are not optimized. they should be optimized before being placed in there final destination. The unoptimized images are already put in the final public/artwork/ dir. If this is a problem then we shall create a temporary folder to place all the imgs before going into the final folder structure.
follow next.js's image optimization and preloading strategies, to eliminate perceived loading times.

the prds and todos in the tasks/ folder is for reference only and outdated. the current implementation has all the requirements covered.

 •  Left arrow: 25% from left edge, top position   
 •  Right arrow: 75% from left edge, top position  
 •  Alignment: Same top level as HOME and category navigation 
 •  Keyboard: Up/down/left/right arrow keys work

 Quest for Infinity, Weather Report, Bubble Moon:                                
 •  Left arrow: Left edge, middle center
 •  Right arrow: Right edge, middle center
 •  Position: Reverted to the original middle-center implementation
 •  Keyboard: Up/down/left/right arrow keys work

 Mobile (All Categories):                                            
 •  Hidden arrows: Navigation buttons completely hidden on mobile
 •  Touch/swipe: Primary navigation method

# Quest for Infinity
 28l.jpg and 28m.jpg looks similar, is this intentional?
